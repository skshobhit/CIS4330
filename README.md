Microservices provide a platform in which the infrastructure of an IT business is more managable. Microservices help make it more able to "independently build,test,package, and deploy scale components within an application". Using these implementations of independently working systems, higher volume of people using online services are more easily managed and are able to use the user interface with less bugs interfering with their work. This is why businesses such as Netflix and Amazon have adopted the use of microservices as an integral part of their infrastructure. Even if companies do not have to deal with user volume/capicity issues they can still benefit from implementing microservices to create new and innovative features in record time. Even though integration of these systems is slowly starting to become more and more prominent, microservice architecture is helping to create a more sustainable future.
